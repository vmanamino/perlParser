"Paul,

This is the first version which I was able to get to pass the sample dialogues illustrated in the lab instructions.  I need some time away from this in order to look at it with a more critical eye.  Perhaps there is a way to make my program more concise or efficient.  I think it's at least effective.  

Paul, this felt good to accomplish.  I started from scratch with no help and built up the program bit by bit.  I experimented, used pen and paper to write out my solutions, and tested my subroutines in separate programs.  My attitude toward programming has changed.  Before I would get perplexed and frustrated.  For this project, I was calm and had confidence even when I didn't have a solution in mind that I would find one.  Thanks for being a great mentor.
